<p><em>foodRecall</em> is an R package that facilitates accessing and
visualizing data from the openFDA API. This document provides
descriptions and examples of the functions included in the package and
some information explaining the process to complete this project for
STAT 585 - Data Technologies for Statistical Analysis at Iowa State
University.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This product uses the openFDA API, but
is not endorsed or certified by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA).</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="backgroundmotivation">Background/Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#backgroundmotivation"></a>
</h2>
<p>This project is motivated by the need for more visualization in
healthcare, especially for food-related problems. In many instances, one
hears about foodborne illnesses in the news, but is unclear of where
such</p>
<p>Our R package contains code, data, and documentation about the
foodborne outbreaks that happened in the United States in the recent
decade. The package helps highlight the city, state, country, and time
the outbreak occurred.</p>

<p>The recall_location function provides a list of all food recalls for
a designated city. Additional functionality includes the ability to
specify inputs such as the firm responsible for each recall, the current
status of the recall, and the distribution pattern (if known). For
example, the above code will display all recalls for the city of
Milwaukee from the company Tyson Foods, which has experienced several
recalls of their chicken products due to listeria bacteria
contamination.</p>

<p>This package allows a user to input a date or range of dates in order
to see what types of food recalls occurred within a certain interval of
time. For instance, the above example displays all food recalls for a
specified location for the first 4 months of 2015 using the date reports
input. ## Limitations</p>
<p>Currently, our package only provides information relating to
foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States.In the future, it would
be beneficial to expand this package to include foodborne illness
statistics from across the globe. In this manner, it would be easy and
efficient to compare illness rates from foodborne diseases in different
countries. Furthermore, it would be possible to track, model, and
predict the spread of foodborne illnesses as they move from nation to
nation, which could lead to early government intervention in containing
the spread of various illnesses. One complication with this, however, is
that a global database would require the combination and analysis of a
large number of datasets. Due to this, and the fact that many nations do
not consistently track disease statistics, this would be quite
ambitious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#future-work"></a>
</h2>
<p>In the future, it would be optimal to try and combine this package
with other information, such as agricultural data from the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) . One of the original ideas for our
project dealt with analyzing crop progress data from the USDA’s National
Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). This service provides
information on statistics such as crop planting, germination, harvest,
etc. Many foodborne illness outbreaks initiate from bacteria, fungi, or
insects that emerge at certain crop development stages. If food-borne
illness and crop progress statistics could be combined and analyzed
together with the same package, it would be much easier for
organizations such as the FDA to predict the severity of food-borne
illnesses and to develop measures for their prevention. It could also be
a useful tool for farmers and others whose work entails a key role in
the prevention of such diseases, such as with the application of
herbicides and other agricultural chemicals. Additional agricultural
statistics from livestock facilities could be combined with these data
sets in order to provide a more complete picture of how livestock yields
over time have impacted rates of foodborne illnesses such as
salmonella.</p>
<p>Another possibility for a future improvement to this package would be
the addition of a feature that enables users to track areas that have
featured the origin of the most food-borne illnesses. If high-risk areas
can be identified by simply keeping a count of the number of cases of a
certain disease over time, it will be easy to pinpoint where many
diseases are originating and how to prevent the spread of such diseases.
Essentially, expansions to this package could enable governmental and
other organizations to work together on joint projects relating to food
safety.</p>
<p>Finally, additional functionality could be created that allows for
the combination of food-borne illness data with other disease related
data. In this sense, it could be useful to healthcare professionals who
are treating such illnesses and may be more interested in treatment
options rather than origin of disease. Hence, it could be useful to
develop functionality with regards to symptoms and symptom severity as
it relates to diseases of interest.</p>
