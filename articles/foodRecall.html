<p><em>foodRecall</em> accesses and visualizes data from the openFDA
Food Recall Enforcement Reports API. This document provides descriptions
and examples of the functions included in the package and some
information explaining the process to complete this project for STAT 585
- Data Technologies for Statistical Analysis at Iowa State
University.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This product uses the openFDA API, but

<h2 id="background-and-motivation">Background and Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background-and-motivation"></a>
</h2>
<p>This project is motivated by the need for more visualization in
healthcare, especially for food-related problems. In many instances,
people are informed about food recalls and foodborne illnesses in the
news, but are unclear of the extent or severity of such occurrences.
Likewise, many healthcare and government organizations maintain
extensive records of food recalls and related illness, but there are few
software packages avaialable for visualizing these types of data. The
foodRecall package strives to make analysis of food recall data more
accessible and easier to read and use so that scientists and civilians
alike are able to make informed choices regarding food safety and
security.</p>
<p>Our R package contains code, data, and documentation about the
foodborne outbreaks that happened in the United States in the recent
decade. The package helps highlight the city, state, country, and time
the outbreak occurred.</p>

</div>
<p>The recall_location function provides a list of all food recalls for
a designated city. Additional functionality includes the ability to
specify inputs such as the firm responsible for each recall, the current
status of the recall, and the distribution pattern (which states/regions
the recall has affected). One must specify their API key as the first
input. For example, the above code will display all recalls over time
for the city of Milwaukee from the company Garden-Fresh Foods, which has
experienced many recalls, including those that are class 1 over time due
to contamination of produce. The tabular output, as shown in the figure
above, includes information such as the reason for recall, description
of the product, quantities of recalled products, and dates of recall.
One can specify any of these columns as an input to the function if they
desire to look more specifically at a particular group of recalls. This
tabular format places all FDA recall variables into a tidy, easy-to-read
format.</p>

Example of output from recall_date function

</div>
<p>This package allows a user to input a date or range of dates in order
to see what types of food recalls occurred within a certain interval of
time. For instance, the above example displays all food recalls starting
on February 1st, 2022 and ending on May 7th of 2-23. Input options
include the date of recall initiation, the current status of the recall,
and the distribution pattern of the recall. This makes it easy and
efficient to see the status of any current or past recalls that might
have had an impact within a certain range of time. One current
limitation, however, is that it does not provide a visually appealing
tabular or graphical format that is similar to aforementioned packages.
However, it is beneficial for looking up a single recall or time period
of interest.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#limitations"></a>
</h2>
<p>Currently, our package only provides information relating to food
recalls. In the future, it would be beneficial to expand this package to
include foodborne illness statistics from across the globe, due to the
fact that many food recalls are initiated by outbreaks of foodborne
diseases. In this manner, it would be easy and efficient to compare
illness rates from foodborne diseases in different countries.
Furthermore, it would be possible to track, model, and predict the
spread of foodborne illnesses as they move from nation to nation, which
could lead to early government intervention in containing the spread of
various illnesses. One complication with this, however, is that a global
database would require the combination and analysis of a large number of
datasets. Due to this, and the fact that many nations do not
consistently track disease statistics, this would be quite
ambitious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#future-work"></a>
</h2>
<p>In the future, it would be optimal to try and combine this package
with other information, such as agricultural data from the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) . One of the original ideas for our
project dealt with analyzing crop progress data from the USDA’s National
Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). This service provides
information on statistics such as crop planting, germination, harvest,
etc. Many foodborne illness outbreaks initiate from bacteria, fungi, or
insects that emerge at certain crop development stages. If food-borne
illness and crop progress statistics could be combined and analyzed
together with the same package, it would be much easier for
organizations such as the FDA to predict the severity of food-borne
illnesses and to develop measures for their prevention. It could also be
a useful tool for farmers and others whose work entails a key role in
the prevention of such diseases, such as with the application of
herbicides and other agricultural chemicals. Additional agricultural
statistics from livestock facilities could be combined with these data
sets in order to provide a more complete picture of how livestock yields
over time have impacted rates of foodborne illnesses such as
salmonella.</p>
<p>Another possibility for a future improvement to this package would be
the addition of a feature that enables users to track areas that have
featured the origin of the most food-borne illnesses. If high-risk areas
can be identified by simply keeping a count of the number of cases of a
certain disease over time, it will be easy to pinpoint where many
diseases are originating and how to prevent the spread of such diseases.
Essentially, expansions to this package could enable governmental and
other organizations to work together on joint projects relating to food
safety.</p>
<p>Finally, additional functionality could be created that allows for
the combination of food-borne illness data with other disease related
data. In this sense, it could be useful to healthcare professionals who
are treating such illnesses and may be more interested in treatment
options rather than origin of disease. Hence, it could be useful to
develop functionality with regards to symptoms and symptom severity as
it relates to diseases of interest.</p>
